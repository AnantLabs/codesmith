<h1>PLINQO for NHibernate</h1>

<p><i>So easy, even a caveman can generate it.</i></p>

<p>PLINQO NH is a Replace and Enhance alternative to NHibernate.<br>
PLINQO NH is available in C#, and supports SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, MySQL, and more!</p>

<h2>What is PLINQO for NHibernate?</h2>

<p>PLINQO is a set of CodeSmith Templates that generate ORM (Object Relational Mapping) frameworks using consistent design patterns and best practices. PLINQO Frameworks also include an advanced set of features to both simplify and optimize the task of data access.</p>

<p>NHibernate is the open source community's ORM of choice. It is a port of Hibernate for Java that has since taken
on a life of it's own. While being very powerful and very customizable, it has been criticized for being difficult
to get started.</p>

<p>PLINQO for NHibernate brings the simplifications, optimizations, and convenience of PLINQO to NHibernate. The ultimate goal is to take the best of both worlds and put them together into a robust framework that is easy to use.</p>
