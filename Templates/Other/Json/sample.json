Unlike environmentally antagonistic auto shows that float visitors down lazy rivers of crude oil on aerosol-powered inner tubes, this year's Dallas Auto Show sports a <a href=\"http://dallasautoshow.com/green.html\">green</a> theme, with manufacturers highlighting planet-pampering hybrids, such as the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Volt, and Toyota Prius V. Automotive enthusiasts of all ages can spend hour after hour kicking tires, smelling new-car smells, and learning the ins and outs of the latest produce from the world's foremost car farmers. Autophiles looking for a more active experience can take part in the all-new ride and drive event, during which attendees can get their kicks behind the wheel as they test drive new road-rompers from Ford, GM, Kia, Toyota, and Subaru. Cameras and video recorders are allowed inside the fest, helping guests preserve their memories, enhance their online dating profiles, and remind their old family wagons that they can be replaced.  </p>\n\n<h3>Reviews</h3>\n\n<p>More than 880 <a href=\"http://gr.pn/eueuZE\">Facebookers</a> like The Dallas Auto Show.</p>","textAd":{"headline":"","line1":"","line2":""},"type":"groupon","startAt":"2011-03-25T05:01:21Z","endAt":"2011-03-28T04:59:59Z","tippedAt":"2011-03-25T07:01:29Z"}
