PLINQO, which stands for Professional LINQ to Objects, is a collection of CodeSmith templates that are meant to replace and extend the LINQ to SQL designers that are included with Visual Studio 2008.
===Features===
  * Generate or update a LINQ to SQL dbml file from a database schema.
  * Includes all tables, stored procedures, functions, and views with the ability to exclude objects based on regex patterns. 
  * Ability to automatically remove object prefix and suffixes (ie. tbl_ and usp_). 
  * Dbml file can still be customized with the normal Visual Studio 2008 designer. 
  * Dbml file can be refreshed based on the current database schema without losing customizations. (See Safe Attributes) 
  * Generation of the LINQ to SQL DataContext class. 
  * Generation of the LINQ to SQL entity classes.
  * Generates one file per entity instead of one massive file. 
  * Generates partial classes where custom code can be written and won't be overwritten. 
  * Generated entity files are added to the project as code behind files to their corresponding custom entity files. 
  * Generation of entity manager classes.
  * Adds customizable business rules engine to enforce entity validation, business and security rules. 
  * Provides access to common queries based on primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes. 
  * Common queries are exposed as IQueryable so they can be extended. 
  * All templates can be customized to meet your needs.
